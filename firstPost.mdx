# Introduction to HTML

In this chapter, we will be covering the basics of HTML.

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

## Why HTML is important?

HTML is used to create webpages. It's constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the W3C, the organization charged with designing and maintaining the language.

## Basic HTML Structure

An HTML Document structure looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
